## My_Convex_Optimization
One of the main challenges of Data Science and more specifically in Machine Learning is the performance measure.How to measure performance efficiently so that our model predictions meet the business objectives? This project is meant to be an introduction to some convex optimization tools and to implement your own optimization algorithm.
* Gradient Descent Methods
* Simplex algorithm
